An E-commerce System is a platform that allows buying and selling of goods or services over the internet. It involves a combination of front-end (what users see) and back-end (server, database, logic) components.
Here’s a breakdown of how an e-commerce system works and what components it typically includes:


---

1. Key Features of an E-commerce System

Frontend (User Interface)

Home page: Highlights categories, deals, or featured products.

Product listing: Shows products with filtering/sorting options.

Product detail page: Detailed info about a product with images, price, and "Add to Cart" button.

Shopping cart: Users review selected products.

Checkout page: Enter shipping info, select payment method, confirm order.

User account area: Order history, saved addresses, profile settings.


Backend (Admin & Server)

Admin dashboard: Manage products, inventory, users, orders.

3. HTML Example: Basic Product Card

<div class="product-card">
  <img src="product.jpg" alt="Product Name" />
  <h2>Product Name</h2>
  <p>$29.99</p>
  <button>Add to Cart</button>
</div>

You’d use CSS for styling and JavaScript for cart actions.
